# CrudApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.1.

## Setup

Install `Node.js`. You can download the latest version of Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). npm is installed automatically with Node.js.

Installing Node.js also installs `npm`, which is the Node.js package manager. `npm` is used to install Angular CLI, which is used to create projects, generate application and library code, and perform a variety of ongoing development tasks such as testing, bundling, and deployment.

Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted`
Run `npm install -g json-server` to install json-server globally.
Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

## Development server

Run `json-server --watch db.json`. This will start the json-server on port 3000. The json-server is used to mock the backend.
Run `ng serve --open` to start the application on port 4200 (`http://localhost:4200/`). The application will automatically open in your default browser. It will also automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
